Hey there! It's me, [42yeah](https://potion4.github.io). I had a boring life, and so I decided to, you know, do something different everyday. And then I think, well, the thing I do **does not have to be meaningful**, but let's keep track of it! So here I am. And here you are, viewing what sh*ts I have done.

你好呀！这里是 [42yeah](https://potion4.github.io) 。大学生活每天都感觉一模一样，所以我决定每天都干点儿不同的东西。然后我就想，恩，我做的东西不一定要有意义吧。但是记录一下总是好的！所以我就开始记录了。而你，亲爱的读者，现在就是在我的记录页里头了。

## Begin!

Avoid stepping on all edges of tiles as long as that tile is bigger than 0.3mx0.5m.

只要那个格子的面积是大于 0.3mx0.5m 的，我就不踩他们的边。

Today, I added a "cola" emoji after my wechat name. 🥤 <- Yep, this one. Some might say isn't it named "[cup with straw](https://emojipedia.org/cup-with-straw/)"? Well, you might be right, but I sincerely don't care.

今天我在我的微信的名字后面加了瓶可乐。 🥤 有的人可能会说，这不是 "[cup with straw](https://emojipedia.org/cup-with-straw/)" 吗？嗯……随便吧……
